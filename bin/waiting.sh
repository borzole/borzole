# This script displays a sequence of characters as an indication that
# the calling script is still running.

# Description:
# ------------
# If another script needs some time to finish its execution a sequence of
# characters can be displayed to indicate that another script is still running.
#
# Call from another script:       nice -n 19 waiting &
# Explicit call to display:
# 1. a r-otating l-ine (default): nice -n 19 waiting rl &
# 2. b-ouncing l-ines:            nice -n 19 waiting bl &
# 3. r-unning d-ots:              nice -n 19 waiting rd &
# 4. b-ouncing d-ots:             nice -n 19 waiting bd &
# 5. an e-xpanding "o":           nice -n 19 waiting eo &
# 6. a r-eappearing p-hrase:      nice -n 19 waiting rp 'your phrase' &
#
# Since waiting is started in the background it will be useful to trap
# signals which cause the calling script to terminate so that waiting can be
# terminated as well. E.g. the following can be defined in the calling script:
#
# nice -n 19 waiting &
# WAITING_PID="$!"
#
# cleanup() {
#    test -n "$WAITING_PID" && kill -TERM $WAITING_PID &> /dev/null
#    exit 0
# }
#
# trap cleanup HUP INT QUIT ABRT TERM EXIT
